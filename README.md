# WorldPovertyApp

App that displays every country in the world along with their Income group and GDP over the years. Used [worldbank's public api](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889386-developer-information-overview) to get the economic data and [https://www.countryflags.com/](https://www.countryflags.com/) to get each country's flag.

## Getting Started

Sometimes, an image won't load because of a 404 error. If the app freezes just resume the app by skipping the error on flutter debug tools.
